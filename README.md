# Charlie Harry Smith

## Political Theorist at the Oxford Internet Institute

I’m a doctoral student at the [Oxford Internet Institute](https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/) and a member of [Balliol College](https://www.balliol.ox.ac.uk/), part of the [University of Oxford](http://www.ox.ac.uk/).

My [research](http://www.chsmith.co.uk/research/) focuses on the social, ethical and political issues surrounding digital government and federated digital identity systems in the UK.

I hold an MSc in Political Theory from the [LSE](http://www.lse.ac.uk/) and a BA in Philosophy from [Durham University](https://www.dur.ac.uk/). Whilst at Durham, I also spent a year studying abroad at the [University of Hong Kong](https://hku.hk/).

When I’m not working, you'll often find me training for competitions with the [Oxford Sirens](http://users.ox.ac.uk/~oxsirens/). During the 2020-21 season I was the club President.
