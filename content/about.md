As a first-class graduate of Philosophy from Durham University, I am a logical, analytical and creative thinker with a proven aptitude for strategic problem-solving. Having lived in five countries, including studying and working in Hong Kong, I am open-minded and quick to adapt, welcoming challenges with a global outlook.

Whilst at Durham University, I received the British Council’s prestigious ‘Scholarship for Excellence’ (£3000) and Trevelyan College’s ‘Greenwood Merit Scholarship’ (£400). I was also later elected Editor-in-Chief of the journal Critique. Diversifying our content and redesigning the website resulted in over 1,250 journal downloads – a 2000% increase from the previous year.

In 2018/19 I read for an MSc in Political Theory at the LSE. I received a distinction in every module and my thesis was titled ‘Corporatised Identities ≠ Digital Identities: Exploiting Expressions of Digital Identity and the Impacts for Relational Autonomy’. In a revised form, this thesis has since been published by Springer as a book chapter in L. Floridi & C. Burr (eds.) Ethics of Digital Well-being: A Multidisciplinary Approach.

In the autumn of 2019 I began research as a doctoral student at Balliol College, part of the University of Oxford. My work is supported by a four-year studentship granted as part of the ESRC’s Grand Union Doctoral Training Partnership and, in particular, focuses on the ethical, social and political issues surrounding federated digital identity systems. My supervisors are Professors Vicki Nash and Helen Margetts. 

Beyond university, I have freelanced to partly fund my education. Most notably, marketing videos I produced for Mvine Ltd. have been used in pitches to clients including the NHS, BT and TfL. Whilst in Hong Kong I also  completed a six-month internship at McCann Health, before later being invited back for a further three-months employment at their subsidiary, Consulting at McCann Health, in London.

Finally, as a former Officer Cadet in the Royal Air Force, I have learned how to confidently handle my responsibilities. Four years of leadership training taught me the importance of time-management and empowering my team – and I graduated with Merit from the selective Air Cadet Leadership Course.
