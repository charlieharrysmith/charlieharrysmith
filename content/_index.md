I’m a doctoral student at the Oxford Internet Institute, pursuing a DPhil in Information, Communication and the Social Sciences as a member of Balliol College. My work is supported by a four-year studentship granted as part of the ESRC’s Grand Union Doctoral Training Partnership and, in particular, focuses on the ethical, social and political issues surrounding federated digital identity systems.

During my time at Oxford, I’m seeking to apply theoretical knowledge from my previous degrees to a concrete technical, social and political problem. I hold both an MSc (with distinction) in Political Theory from the London School of Economics (LSE) and a first-class BA in single-honours Philosophy from Durham University.  Whilst at Durham, I spent my penultimate year studying abroad at the University of Hong Kong and served as Editor-in-Chief of Critique during my final year. When I’m not working, you’ll probably find me managing, training and competing for the Oxford Sirens university cheerleading squad which, for the year 2020-2021, I am running as club President.
