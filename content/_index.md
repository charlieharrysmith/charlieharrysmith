I’m a doctoral student at the [Oxford Internet Institute](https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/), pursuing a DPhil in Information, Communication and the Social Sciences as a member of [Balliol College](https://www.balliol.ox.ac.uk/), a consituent college of the [University of Oxford](http://www.ox.ac.uk/). My work is supported by a four-year studentship granted as part of the ESRC’s [Grand Union](https://www.granduniondtp.ac.uk/) Doctoral Training Partnership and, in particular, focuses on the ethical, social and political issues surrounding federated digital identity systems. I am currently supervised by Professors [Victoria Nash](https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/people/victoria-nash) and [Helen Margetts](https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/people/helen-margetts).

During my time at Oxford, I’m seeking to apply theoretical knowledge from my previous degrees to a concrete technical, social and political problem. When I’m not working, you’ll probably find me managing, training and competing for the [Oxford Sirens](http://users.ox.ac.uk/~oxsirens/) university cheerleading squad which, for the year 2020-2021, I am running as club President.
